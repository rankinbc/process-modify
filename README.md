###Description
Process Modify is an application that manipulates RAM belonging to a process during runtime.

* You can store and name variables located at a specific memory addresses and modify them to make changes in the attached process.
* You can also edit memory directly using a hex editor. This is useful in finding addresses where specific variables are located.
* Finally, you can corrupt memory by randomizing values in a section of RAM. The memory locations that are randomized are determined by an interval and chunk size. This can yield interesting results in the behavior of the attached process.
