# process-modify
(2015) Useful for manipulating known memory addresses of other processes.

Process Modify is an application that useful for modifying memory values of running processes. It was originally created as a tool to hack video game ROMs, but it can be used for other purposes.

The advantage of Process Modify over a plain hex editor is that rather than just setting the value in a specified memory address, you can set a minimum and maximum range and simply use a scrollbar to set the values.
