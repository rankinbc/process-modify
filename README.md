# Process Modify

Process Modify is an application that useful for modifying memory values of running processes. It was originally created as a tool to hack video game ROMs, but it can be used for other purposes also.

The advantage of Process Modify over a plain hex editor is that rather than just setting the value in a specified memory address, you can set a minimum and maximum range and use a scrollbar to adjust and tweak the values.

For finding memory addresses, I would suggest using a more complex tool such as <a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">Ollydbg</a> or <a href="http://memoryhacking.com/index.php">L Spiro's Memory Hacking Software"</a>. You can find addresses with Process Modify using the hex editor, but it is not as effective.
